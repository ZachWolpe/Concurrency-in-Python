This repo demonstates how to implement:
    - A detailed description of concurrency, parallelism, and asyncronous programming.
    - A simple distributed architecture with Python & Redis.
    - An example of a distributed, queue-based, distributed system, ideal for horizontally scaling CPU bound workloads.
    - Examples of asyncronous programming using Python's `asyncio` library.
    - Examples of concurrency using Python's `threading` library.
