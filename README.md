This repo demonstates how to implement:
- A detailed description of [concurrency, parallelism, and asyncronous programming](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/blob/main/concurrency.md).
- A simple [distributed architecture](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/blob/main/distributed_computing.md) with Python & Redis.
- An explanation of the [distributed architecture](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/blob/main/distributed-computing-architecture.md)
- [An example](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/tree/main/distributed-computation) of a distributed, queue-based, distributed system, ideal for horizontally scaling CPU bound workloads.
- [Examples](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/blob/main/code/asyncIO.py) of asyncronous programming using Python's `asyncio` library.
- [Examples](https://github.com/ZachWolpe/Distributed-Computing-and-Concurrency-in-Python/tree/main/code) of concurrency using Python's `threading` library.
